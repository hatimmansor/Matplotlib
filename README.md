# Summary
I have analyzed a complete dataset from Mockaroo (2021) most recent animal study. In this study, there are 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. I have generated all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report (scenario) of the study. The proposed executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.

# Code Snapshots and Results:
  * The `mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM` of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.

  * The total number of timepoints `plot` for all mice tested for each drug regimen throughout the course of the study.

  * Using Matplotlib, I have generated a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens, highlighted any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style.<br>

  * `Correlation and Regression:` Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. Ploting the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.
